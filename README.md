## Project Structure


## Developing On Linux
(WIP)

## Developing On Windows
Building the Visual Studio project
```
$> cd ${PROJECTROOT}
$> cmake -S . -B build/
```
Now just open the mechfighter3000.sln file and set the project as the startup project through
the solution explorer window.

TODO: Fix this with correct cmake commands.
If you want to see the log messages on a console instead of debugger consoler. Change the Project's Linker->System->SubSystem to Console

Then proceed to run the project using visual studio's debugger.

### Things To Note
Might need to compile stb atleast once before running.
